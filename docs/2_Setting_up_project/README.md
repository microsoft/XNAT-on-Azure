# Setting up a project

Data stored within XNAT is organized according to projects. We will be using XNAT projects to curate data and also manage annotations. 

XNAT's documentation provides a detailed overview of [creating a project](https://wiki.xnat.org/documentation/how-to-use-xnat/creating-and-managing-projects)


The [setup jupyter notebook](setup.ipynb) provides an overview on how to store and organize labels on XNAT
